I am an ambitious deep learning researcher, eager to explore the capabilities of generative deep learning models and self-supervised methods. My specific interest lies in generative models, particularly in the realm of 2D and 3D computer vision. Currently, I am pursuing graduate studies at Koc University, focusing on video editing using diffusion models. Additionally, I proudly serve as one of the two ambassadors of Hugging Face and Microsoft in Turkey. Beyond my academic pursuits, I am also a professional athlete, firmly believing in the collective strength of teamwork. This ethos profoundly influences my approach to research and collaboration, and I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to interdisciplinary teams.
