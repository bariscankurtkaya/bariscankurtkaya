I am one of the two Hugging Face Ambassadors and the Microsoft Ambassador in Turkey. My ultimate goal encompasses two areas. First, I would like to develop solutions to computer vision problems by enabling smart machine learning systems, being able to learn as humans with minimal/no supervision. Second, I want to make these black-boxes more transparent. Therefore, I intend to focus on the area of beyond supervised learning, wishing to change and develop our perspective on artificial intelligence.
