Hi! My name is BarÄ±ÅŸcan Kurtkaya. I am one of the two Hugging Face Ambassadors in Turkey. I'm a 4th-year bachelor's student at YÄ±ldÄ±z Technical University. Currently, I'm a Visiting Student at UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Milano. I want to work on Computer Vision, Explained AI, Deep Learning Architectures and Optimizing. I worked on semi-autonomous underwater vehicles, driver assistance systems with computer vision, and unmasked person detection systems with deep learning before. I'm almost finished with the driver assistance system with computer vision paper and I will send it to the journal as an article. Also, I'm learning Capsule Network architecture to understand deep learning more.

I love to code with C/C++ and Python but I know more than 5 languages and did so many projects in different fields (AI (CV, NLP, CNN, RNN etc.), Backend (SpringBoot, LoopBack4, NestJs, Go etc.), FrontEnd (Angular), DevOps (Docker, AWS, Azure, RabbitMQ etc.), Robotics (STM32F4, Raspberry etc.) etc.).

I want to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Vision, Optimization and Explainability. Also, I wanted to win Turing Award and want to change and develop our perspective on artificial intelligence.

Keep aiming for the moon, even if you miss you'll land among the stars.
